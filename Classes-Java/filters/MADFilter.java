Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) of an array of numbers

Median Absolute Deviation is a robust way to identify outliers.
Conceptually it's replacing standard deviation or variance with median
deviation and the mean with the median. The result is a method that isnâ€™t
as affected by outliers as using the mean and standard deviation.

x~ is the median of the sample
MAD is the absolute difference between the median and each point in the sample
MAD = median{|xi - x~|}
modified Z-score Mi = 0.6745(xi - x~)/MAD
rule of thumb is |Mi| > 3.5 is an outlier (or |Mi| > 3.0)
0.6745 is the 0.75th quartile of the standard normal distribution, to which the MAD converges
